Project Documentation – Calculator (Python)
1. Project Overview

This project is a simple console-based Calculator created using Python.
It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of VS Code, Git, and GitHub for software development, version control, and documentation.

2. Project Objective

To understand how to build a small functional program using Python

To learn how to use VS Code for coding and testing

To practice Git commands such as git init, git add, git commit, and git push

To maintain a clean repository structure on GitHub

To create proper documentation for a mini-project

3. Tools and Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Code Editor: Visual Studio Code

Version Control: Git

Repository Hosting: GitHub

4. Development Process
Step 1: Project Setup

Created a folder for the project

Opened it in VS Code

Created the main Python file named calculator.py

Step 2: Writing the Program

Added functions for each arithmetic operation

Added input handling

Added checks for invalid operations and division by zero

Tested the program in VS Code terminal

Step 3: Initializing Git

Executed these commands in VS Code terminal:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Step 4: Making Multiple Commits

Made meaningful commits for changes in code, README file, documentation, and screenshots.

Step 5: Pushing to GitHub

Created a repository on GitHub and pushed the project using:

git remote add origin <repo-link>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Step 6: Adding Documentation

Created a docs/ folder and added this documentation file.

5. Folder Structure
calculator.py
README.md
.gitignore
assets/ (contains screenshots)
docs/
   documentation.md

6. Features of the Application

Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Shows error message when dividing by zero

Simple and easy to use

Beginner-friendly program

Can be extended with more features in future

7. Challenges Faced

Learning basic Git commands

Understanding how to maintain a clean repository

Managing files such as .gitignore, assets, and documentation

Understanding where to put code vs. documentation

8. Future Improvements

Adding a graphical user interface (GUI)

Adding scientific functions

Adding more input validation

Converting it into a web-based calculator

Adding automated tests

9. Conclusion

This mini-project successfully demonstrates the use of Python, VS Code, Git, and GitHub.
It shows practical understanding of programming, version control, documentation, and repository management.
The calculator works properly and the project is structured professionally as required in the assignment.
